Please follow the following steps to obtain coreference between various entities and mentions in user defined text:
1. The mail .java file is called coreferenceResolutionCaseless.java and the corresponding file for truecase text is 
called coreferenceResolutionTrueCase.java
2. The steps to obtain coreference using either truecase or caseless model are exactly the same.
3. Change the text which is currently passed as an argument to new Annotation() function call in the line number 17 of the code, 
enclosed by inverted commas
4. Run the java file and the output will generated on the console.
5. Sample output-

  A chain means an entity along with its mentions. We assume the first entry in a chain to be the main entity and subsequent 
  entries in the next lines its mentions. The character offsets tell the starting and ending index of the text enclosed in 
  inverted commas.
